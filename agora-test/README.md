This folder is the test suite for Agora governance system.

-   `/Spec` contains different tests for different elements
    of Agora.
-   `/Spec/Model` contain `apropos-tx` model for
    logical suite generation and tests.
-   `/Spec/Sample` contains primitive hand-made example
    values.
-   `Util.hs` contains helper functions

Currently, planning to introduce `plutarch-test` for unit
tests, benchmarks, and golden tests.
